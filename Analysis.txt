### Big O Analysis

####Task 0:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(1)
Time-complexity is Big O(1) because we are accessing the first and last value from the lists by an index.

####Task 1:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(n)
Time-complexity is Big O(n) because we are accessing all the values in the list in the list comprehension.

####Task 2:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(n)
Time-complexity is Big O(n) because we are accessing all the values in the list in the list comprehension.

####Task 3:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(n)
Time-complexity is Big O(n) because we are accessing all the values in the list in the list comprehension.

####Task 4:
Worst case time-complexity is Big O(n)
Time-complexity is Big O(n) because we are accessing all the values in the list in the list comprehension.
