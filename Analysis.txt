### Big O Analysis

### Task 0:
Worst case time-complexity is O(1)
Time-complexity is O(1) because we are accessing the first and last value from the lists by an index.

### Task 1:
Worst case time-complexity is O(n)
Time-complexity is O(n) because we are accessing all the values in the list

### Task 2:
Worst case time-complexity is O(N^2)
Time-complexity is O(N^2) because of nesting in operator

### Task 3:
Worst case time-complexity is O(logN)
Time-complexity is O(logN) because of sorting

### Task 4:
Worst case time-complexity is O(logN)
Time-complexity is O(logN) because of sorting
